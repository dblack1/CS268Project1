    <h2>Itemized breakdown</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You will create a website for a client of your choosing. Your client
        could be a family member, a business, a student group, a friend, an
        online community, and so on. The only restriction is that the client
        cannot be just you.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I created my website for my dad's business: Black's Valley Ag. It is
          an ag supply dealer and store.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Your site must include some sort of header.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>My site includes a header that contains the navbar.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must contain at least five separate pages, each having a
        meaningful purpose.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My site contains a home page, about page, testimonial page,
          products/services page, and contact page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Your site must include some sort of navigation links.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My site has navigation links in the navbar as well as in the footer
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens. For
        instance, multicolumn layouts on large screens should be reduced to
        single column layouts on small screens. You are encouraged to implement
        separate layouts using CSS media queries.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My site has seperate layouts for large and small screens and it uses
          media queries to change between these. I've had experience with the
          grid but not with flexbox so I decided to only use flexbox so I could
          learn more about it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must maintain a coherent style across its pages. Global style
        rules must be placed in a shared stylesheet. Individual pages&#8217;
        style rules must be placed in a separate stylesheets.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have a global styles rules file and then separate files for styles
          that are specific to each page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must include images, and their <code>alt</code> attributes
        must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers,
        user with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every image on my site has an associated alt tag that describes the
          picture accurately.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Each page must declare its favicon.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All of my pages have a favicon on them as well as a descriptive title.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site&#8217;s non-HTML resources must be organized. Images must be
        placed in a directory named <code>images</code>. CSS files must be
        placed in a directory named <code>css</code>. JavaScript must be placed
        in a directory named <code>js</code>.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>I have separate folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must not be built using any libraries or frameworks. Do not
        use Bootstrap, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue, or any other third-party
        tools. You may, however, reimplement the ideas you see in these
        third-party tools.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>My project only consists of vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javscript</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings
        or errors using the W3C&#8217;s
        <a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/" target="_blank"
          >HTML validator</a
        >
        and
        <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank"
          >CSS validator</a
        >.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I ran all of my files through the validators and they had no errors or
          warnings.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must be stored in a Git repository that you have shared with
        your instructor. On GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, share with the user
        <code>twodee</code>.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My site is stored on
          <a href="https://github.com/dblack1/CS268Project1" target="_blank"
            >Github</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        The names of your files should be entirely lowercase and contain only
        alphanumeric characters.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My files are lowercase and they only contain letters and numbers
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Your site must be served out of port 8443.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>It is served out of port 8443</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must be accessed only through HTTPS. You are encouraged to use
        <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/" target="_blank"
          >Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a
        >
        to obtain a free certificate.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I used Lets Encrypt to add SSL to my site and ensure that it's
          accessed through HTTPS.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your content should be neatly aligned. The axes should be clearly
        visible.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I did my best to maintain axes throughout my pages. I had the hardest
          time keeping strong axes on the home page and testimonial page because
          there is more content on them, but I think that it still looks good.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often
        rendered in a sans-serif font, and copy in a serif font.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>I used Muli, Roboto, Varela, and Jomolhari on my site</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must include at least one form (or informal collection of
        input elements). The form might submit data to a server or invoke some
        client-side JavaScript function that alters the page. The action is not
        specified.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My form is on the contact page and it just displays what the user
          input once they hit submit. I have it so you can only submit if all
          fields are filled.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must include links to external sites. Clicking on external
        links must open a new tab or window rather than replace your page.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have links to the companies social media accounts in the footer
          section. I used <code>target="_blank"</code> to open them in new tabs
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your source code must be readable, using conventional and consistent
        formatting and meaningful names for classes and IDs.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I used the Prettier plugin to format my code. It makes some things
          look weird but it makes all of my code consistent. I used kabob style
          for CSS classes and IDs and used names that were specific to the
          element(s) they were affecting
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Your site must include at least one animation, powered either by CSS or
        JavaScript.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My site uses an animation on the about page to automatically go
          through images like a carousel. It took me a while to figure this out,
          but it ended up being pretty simple and I think it's pretty cool.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <h2>Client Critique</h2>
    <p>
      Overall I think Dylan&apos;s website was very well done. I thought that
      the overall feel of the website captured our company well. One thing I
      liked about the website was how easy it was to navigate by using the links
      on the top of the webpage. I also liked the home page and how there was a
      picture that was the fullscreen. One thing that could be added is a little
      bit more about our fertilizer sales. They are a good amount of our sales
      and a popular service that we offer. I think that a picture of our soybean
      treatment plant could have also been included, possibly on the products
      page. One thing I would change is on the home page when clicking the
      &quot;see what we can do&quot; I think it should go to the
      &quot;about&quot; tab instead of the &quot;products&quot; tab.
